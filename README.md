Image classification with CNN.
Use Case Description:
Image Classification with CNN
1. Training the model
2. Evaluating the model

Programming elements:
1. About CNN
2. Hyperparameters of CNN
3. Image classification with CNN

Checked the performance of the model
The performance of the model is likely to improve with the addition of more layers and higher number of feature maps, but it will also increase the complexity and the training time of the model. The new model architecture provided in the instruction includes several new layers and higher number of feature maps, which may improve the accuracy of the model.

2. Predict the first 4 images of the test data using the above model. Then, compare with the actual label for those 4 
images to check whether or not the model has predicted correctly.
3. Visualize Loss and Accuracy using the history object

it predicted correctly 
and visualized the history object.
